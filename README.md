# Upsolver

## Overview

Upsolver is a tool designed specifically for competitive programmers and team coaches, aimed at optimizing the upsolving process and streamlining team progress management.

## User Context

### Users Roles

- **Contestant:** user who wants to learn by upsolving problems and receive help from his coach in form of hints.

- **Coach:** user who Manages and guides competitive programming teams and provides hints to problems.

### User Personas

#### Of Contestants

- Diego is a 20-year-old Mexican man who is currently in his sophomore year of computer science. A year ago, he entered the world of competitive programming to learn more and be more attractive to companies that hire interns. Feeling frustrated with his progress, Diego sought the help of more experienced competitors and they told him that in order to improve he must do upsolving, which is when you try to solve the problems that you couldn’t solve during a contest, they also told him that he must do the upsolving with his team and not alone, as this will make it easier for him to be consistent. Diego appreciates the advice of his friends, but the idea of doing upsolving seems overwhelming. He has too many pending contests to upsolve, and it seems to him that doing so is an impossible task. Also, he gets a lot of anxiety asking his teammates about their progress with upsolving.

- Alexia is a 19-year-old student from Mexico who is currently studying her first year of engineering in data science and mathematics. She has a lot of experience in math competitions and upon entering university she was drawn to her to also participate in programming competitions, so she joined a team from her university. Her team is quite big, it has three competitors, a substitute, a coach and two co-coaches. To upsolve, Alexia's team currently uses a shared Excel file where everyone records their progress, and to ask for help when she's stuck with a problem, she does it via direct message to her coaches and teammates, because if she does it in a group chat everyone would get spoiled with the answer. Alexia is fine with the current system, but when there is a new contest and it is her turn to add it to the Excel file, it takes her a long time to capture the information of the problems. In addition, she feels that sometimes her trainers answer her questions with some annoyance, since they are questions that they have already answered for other people as well.

#### Of Coaches

- Leonardo is a 23-year-old Mexican man who is currently about to graduate from a computer science degree. During his time at the university, he competed in the ICPC, qualifying for two world finals and is currently the coach of several teams in Mexico. Leonardo likes to help his apprentices by answering their questions, but his job doesn’t give him much time to do so. Also, Leonardo is sometimes puzzled by not knowing the progress the teams he coaches are making and whether the time he is investing in them is helping them to improve.

- Sofia is a 24-year-old Mexican woman who just graduated and is currently working full time at Oracle MDC. A couple of months ago, an ICPC team from her old university contacted her to ask her to be her coach and she accepted. When talking with her new team, Sofía realized that they don’t do upsolving, so she plans to recommend that they do so she is looking for strategies to make it easier for them to start doing it.
